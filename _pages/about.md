I am a [ESRC Ph.D. Student](https://www.ninedtp.ac.uk/wangyin-zhao-a-disaster-for-whom-the-conditional-impact-of-natural-disasters-on-civil-conflicts/) at [Centre for Institutions and Political Behaviour(CIPB)](https://www.durham.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/institutions-political-behaviour/) at Durham University. I received a [MSc in International Relations(Research)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-relations) at LSE and a [BA in International Studies](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/humanities-and-social-sciences/schools-and-department/international-studies/home.aspx) at University of Nottingham, Ningbo campus.  

I use advanced quantitative method to study climate change, natural disasters, and violence. My Ph.D. dissertation titled as "A disaster for whom? The conditional impact of natural disasters on civil conflicts" investigates whether this relationship is moderated by where the disaster hits, by sources of rebel-group finance, and by the government aid. Additionally, I also interested in and welcome the topics including the ethnic identity of the second-generation immigrants, political or social trust and mega-events, and how climate change affects public attitude or voting.  

Beyond the academica, I am a fan of hiking, cycling, and nature.
