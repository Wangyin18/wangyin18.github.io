Welcome! I am a fourth-year [ESRC Ph.D. Student](https://www.ninedtp.ac.uk/wangyin-zhao-a-disaster-for-whom-the-conditional-impact-of-natural-disasters-on-civil-conflicts/) at [Centre for Institutions and Political Behaviour(CIPB)](https://www.durham.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/institutions-political-behaviour/) at Durham University, and a Doctoral Fellow at [Empirical Studies of Conflict(ESOC)](https://esoc.princeton.edu) at Princeton University. 

I use advanced quantitative method to study natural disasters and violence, with a particular focus on Southeast Asia and Africa. My Ph.D. thesis titles as "Natural Disasters and Conflict Dynamics" and is supervised by [Dr. Anouk S Rigterink](https://www.anoukrigterink.com) and [Prof. Patrick M Kuhn](https://sites.google.com/site/pmkuhndr/home?pli=1). My research can be found in *[Journal of Conflict Resolution]*(https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00220027251346912).
