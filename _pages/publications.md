**Natural Disasters and Violent Conflicts: the Role of Social Organizations** <br> 
*The thesis for the master degree at LSE* <br> 
> The security implication of natural disasters has received increasing attention from policymakers and academics in recent years. Despite the natural disaster-conflict link being widely assumed in the policy and popular field, scholars have still not reached a consensus on this link and present mixed empirical results. This study examines whether the extent of state repression of social organizations explains why natural disasters sometimes lead to violent conflicts but at other times not. Using insights from most previous literatures, this study understands natural disasters as related to affect the grievances of people. Still, whether their grievances transform into violent conflicts highly depends on the factors that help promote collective mobilization. Specifically, the occurrence of violent conflicts after natural disasters is moderated by high state repression of social organizations. When social organizations including Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and political parties face less repression, mobilizing structures have more resources to draw upon to engage in collective action. Also, less-constrained organizations will engage in framing the existing grievances into group-level phenomena, which increases the risk of violent conflicts. Using the institutional data from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project and the data on riots retrieved from the Social Conflict Analysis Dataset (SCAD) in Africa from 1990 to 2014, the findings suggest that the conditional effect of state repression of social organizations varies across the different types of natural disasters. Higher state repression of social organizations decreases the likelihood of riots when droughts arise. However, after rapid-onset disasters, this conditional effect of social organizations disappears.

**Research: The Political Participation of Ethnic Minority Group** <br> 
*Based on the assignment for a undergraduate module* <br> 
> In the current discussion of British politics, the political participation of ethnic minority groups has always been a key topic that cannot be neglected. Especially after the 21st century, the constant increase in international migrations has contributed to the formation of a more diverse society across the UK (Sandovici and Listhaug, 2010: 111-112). Given the crucial role of political participation in the accountability of government, it is important for the UK to integrate these ethnic minority groups (New British) into British society. Thus, more attention should be paid to the political participation of ethnic minority groups. This paper will attempt to clarify the political participation of ethnic minority groups through comparing with the ethnic majority and address the research question: “To what extent does being a member of an ethnic minority group influence political participation?”
