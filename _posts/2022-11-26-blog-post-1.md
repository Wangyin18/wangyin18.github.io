This is a blog post can be read in my Blogger with full references. Please click [here](https://wangyinzhao.blogspot.com/2022/11/will-continued-strict-anti-covid.html).

I try to answer the question: Will the continued strict anti-Covid measures in China be more likely to lead to the large-scale social movement?
